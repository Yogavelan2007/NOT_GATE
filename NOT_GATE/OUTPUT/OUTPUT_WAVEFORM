The output waveform of the CMOS NOT gate demonstrates the inverter’s fundamental behavior — producing the logical complement of the input signal.

When the input voltage from the VPULSE rises from 0 V (logic LOW) to 1 V (logic HIGH), the output voltage drops from approximately 1 V to 0 V, indicating a logical LOW at the output. This occurs because the NMOS transistor turns ON (conducts) and the PMOS transistor turns OFF, pulling the output node to ground.

Conversely, when the input voltage falls from 1 V back to 0 V, the output voltage rises from 0 V back to approximately 1 V, indicating a logical HIGH at the output. Here, the PMOS transistor turns ON while the NMOS transistor turns OFF, connecting the output to the positive supply voltage.

The transitions in the output waveform correspond closely with the input’s rise and fall times, though there may be slight propagation delay due to the transistor switching characteristics.

The waveform’s steady states at HIGH (~1 V) and LOW (~0 V) levels confirm the NOT gate’s proper operation at the given voltage swing.
